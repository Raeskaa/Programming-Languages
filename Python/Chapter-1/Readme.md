#Chapter-1 Modules, Comments & Pip
Let’s write our very first python program.

Create a file called hello.py and paste the below code into it
'''
print(“Hello World”) # print is a function (more later)
'''
Execute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py, and you will see Hello World printed on the screen.

### Modules

A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs.

### Pip

Pip is a package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your system.S
E.g., pip install flask (It will install flask module in your system)

### Types of modules

There are two types of modules in Python:

- Built-in modules – Pre-installed in Python
- External modules – Need to install using pip
  Some examples of built-in modules are os, abc, etc.

Some examples of external modules are TensorFlow, flask, etc.

## Using Python as a Calculator
